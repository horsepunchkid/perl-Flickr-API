Flickr::API
===========

Simple interface to the Flickr API.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install



A NOTE ON TESTING

Testing OAuth authentication requires, at minimum, your Flickr
api_key and api_secret; a file with some minimal configuration
data in Storable.pm format that the tests can read and write;
the ability to open a url on Flickr; and the ability to retrieve 
a redirect from Flickr. Since there is some user interaction 
required, full OAuth testing has to be done manually with something
like:

make test MAKETEST_OAUTH_CFG=$HOME/oauth-testing.st [TEST_VERBOSE=1]

There are two scripts in the examples directory that can be used to build
and verify a Storable.pm format configuration file:

examples/make_stored_config.pl and examples/dump_stored_config.pl

When using OAuth, the api_key and api_secret are called 
the consumer_key and consumer_secret respectively.

It is possible to use the OAuth testing to produce a configuration
in storable format that can be imported into the Flickr::API for
future use.
